<h1 align="center">EdgeTech-Template</h1>

  <p align="center">
    This repo is a template of how to build on <a href="https://github.com/IQTLabs/edgetech-core">IQT Labs EdgeTech-Core</a> functionality to instantiate an <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.mosquitto">MQTT</a> client. The philosophy behind EdgeTech-Core is to minimize development requirements for standing up the software stack of an "edge" system. The template includes all of the files and code scaffolds required to build in the EdgeTech framework. All of this functionality is wrapped in a Docker container for cross-platform compatibility. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You'll need to rename various files and directories as well as customize based on your functional needs, but the EdgeTech framework and scaffolding should minimize the development requirements. If you don't find that to be the case, submit a pull request and help us make this repository better!

</p>

### Prerequisites

Running this repo requires that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for containerization, [Poetry][Poetry-url] for dependency management, and [Python 3.11.1][Python-url] is the version we've been building with.

## Usage

Hit `Use this template` and `Create a new repository` to get started. Name it `edgetech-` plus whatever functionality you're adding. You'll also want to rename everything that says `template` in this repository with that name.

Within the `template` directory, you should find several files: a `Dockerfile`, `pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`, and `template_pub_sub.py`. 

`pyproject.toml` is generated by running `poetry init` as we recommend using [`poetry`][Poetry-url] to manage dependencies. 

Once the `pyproject.toml` has been created, use `poetry install` to generate the `poetry.lock` file. You'll want to run `poetry config virtualenvs.create false` and `poetry install --no-dev` before calling `poetry install`. 

### BaseMQTTPubSub Child Class

The core module that is a python wrapper around interacting with MQTT system, heartbeats and tests. The `template_pub_sub.py` file includes examples of recommended usage of the `BaseMQTTPubSub` module and how to build a child class using it. 

An outline of the basic functionality can be found below.

Inheriting `BaseMQTTPubSub`:
```python
from base_mqtt_pub_sub import BaseMQTTPubSub

class TemplatePubSub(BaseMQTTPubSub):
    def __init__(
        self: Any,
        ...
        **kwargs: Any,
    ):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
```
The use of `**kwargs` allows you to override any of the class parameters set in the `BaseMQTTPubSub` constructor. 

In the constructor of the child class, it is recommended that you connect to the MQTT client and publish a message to the `/registration` topic upon successful connection.
```python
self.connect_client()
sleep(1)
self.publish_registration("Template Module Registration")
```

Every child class should include a `main()` function which includes a publishing to the `/heartbeat` channel to keep the connection alive and any subscriptions to other topics in the system. It should also include a `while True` loop to keep the main thread alive and flush all scheduled function calls.
```python
  def main(self: Any) -> None:
        schedule.every(10).seconds.do(
            self.publish_heartbeat, payload="Template Module Heartbeat"
        )

        self.add_subscribe_topic(self.example_topic, self._example_callback)

        ...

        while True:
            try:
                schedule.run_pending()
                sleep(0.001)

            except Exception as e:
                if self.debug:
                    print(e)
```

To call the child class see that the environment variables are passed via `docker-compose` and passed to the constructor. The `main()` function is then called.

```python
    template = TemplatePubSub(
        ...,
        mqtt_ip=os.environ.get("MQTT_IP"),
    )
    template.main()
```

### Docker

Examples of a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` can also be found in this repo. Adding whatever environment variables that your class needs should go into your `.env` file after renaming the `template.env` and paths/names will need to be adjusted as well. The `Dockerfile` should only require script name/path changes as well. 

### Topic Names

Recommended topic names should follow the format specified below.

```python
f"{DEVICE}/{HOST_NAME}/{DATA_TYPE}/{CONTAINER_NAME}/{TYPE_LITERAL}"
```

Example:
```python
f"/AISonobuoy/{HOST_NAME}/AIS/edgetech-daisy/bytestring
```

 ## Roadmap
